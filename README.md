## Its a project to Quantize Images in an Optimal Time Using MST Prim's Algorithm 

* What is Image Quantization?

The idea of color quantization is to reduce the number of colors in a full resolution digital color image (24 bits per pixel) to a smaller set of representative colors called color palette. Reduction should be performed so that the quantized image differs as little as possible from the original image. Algorithmic optimization task is to find such a color palette that the overall distortion is minimized. 

* An example of color quantization is depicted in the following Figure. First, a color palette is found by using clustering algorithm and then the original image values are replaced by their closest values in the palette.
